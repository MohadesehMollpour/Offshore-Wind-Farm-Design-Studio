# C26 — Gross annual energy calculation

[Specification](SPECIFICATION.md) · [Data sources](DATA_SOURCES.md) · [Specialist prompt](SYSTEM_PROMPT.md) · [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) · [All categories](../../docs/CATEGORIES.md)

## Implemented behavior

Gross energy from the selected compatible curve/wind path; annualization and height treatment stay explicit.

**Reference checkpoint:** revision 17, `7a527938-aa43-4d17-8203-9ce2d64d0bb1`; classification **source-backed screening**, result `needs-review`, evidence maturity `published_data_with_modelling_assumptions`. This is the saved Hornsea reference, not a claim about every scenario or engineering completion.

**Code:** `backend/engine.py and backend/external_analysis.py`; view `dashboard/src/main.tsx`. The category adapter is `src/controller.py`. Ownership: [A09](../../agents/A09_energy/AGENT.md).

## Evidence and continuation

Required domain inputs: wind probabilities, power curve. Expected specialist outputs: gross MWh/yr and capacity factor. These remain requirements where evidence or a specialist method is missing. Read the source guide and current result gaps before extending the package.

Preserve provider/project/site/AOI/reference-point scope, source hashes, units and assumption labels. See [the handover](../../PROJECT_HANDOVER.md) for the implementation map and verification workflow.
