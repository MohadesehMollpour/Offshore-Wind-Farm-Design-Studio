# C21 — Power curve, cut-in, cut-out and rated output

## Implemented behavior

Published theoretical IEA 15 MW curve for the explicit regional case, or the labelled cubic proxy for configured site inputs.

**Reference checkpoint:** revision 17, `7a527938-aa43-4d17-8203-9ce2d64d0bb1`; classification **source-backed screening**, result `needs-review`, evidence maturity `published_data_with_modelling_assumptions`. This is the saved Hornsea reference, not a claim about every scenario or engineering completion.

**Code:** `backend/engine.py and backend/external_analysis.py`; view `dashboard/src/main.tsx`. The category adapter is `src/controller.py`. Ownership: [A07](../../agents/A07_turbines/AGENT.md).

## Evidence and continuation

Required domain inputs: verified/manufacturer power curves. Expected specialist outputs: power curve provenance, annual production inputs. These remain requirements where evidence or a specialist method is missing. Read the source guide and current result gaps before extending the package.

Preserve provider/project/site/AOI/reference-point scope, source hashes, units and assumption labels. See [the handover](../../PROJECT_HANDOVER.md) for the implementation map and verification workflow.
